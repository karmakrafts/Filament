 * A reader-writer lock that allows multiple concurrent readers but exclusive writers.

 * - Read locks (via [Lockable] methods): Multiple threads can hold read locks simultaneously
 * - Write locks (via write-specific methods): Only one thread can hold a write lock, and no read locks can be held simultaneously
 *
 * This is useful for scenarios where reads are more frequent than writes, allowing for better concurrency
 * than a standard mutex when multiple readers are active.

 * providing exclusive access with no concurrent readers or writers.

 * val sharedMutex = SharedMutex()
 * val result = sharedMutex.guardedWrite {

 *     // Modify shared resources safely here
 *     computeResult()

 * Attempts to execute the given [closure] while holding the write lock, returning a [defaultValue] if the lock cannot be acquired.

 * Unlike [guardedWrite], this function does not block if the write lock is already held by another thread
 * or if there are active readers. Instead, it makes a single attempt to acquire the write lock using [SharedMutex.tryLockWrite]:
 * - If successful, it executes the [closure] and returns its result
 * - If unsuccessful, it immediately returns the provided [defaultValue] without executing the closure
 *
 * This is useful for non-blocking operations where you want to perform a write operation only if
 * the write lock is immediately available.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val sharedMutex = SharedMutex()
 * val result = sharedMutex.tryGuardedWrite(defaultResult) {
 *     // This code only executes if the write lock was successfully acquired
 *     // Otherwise, defaultResult is returned without executing this block
