/**
 * A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared state.
 *
 * A Mutex provides a mechanism to ensure that only one thread can access a critical
 * section of code at a time, preventing race conditions in concurrent programming.
 *
 * This interface extends [Lockable], providing the core locking operations:
 * - [lock] to acquire the mutex (blocking until available)
 * - [tryLock] to attempt to acquire the mutex without blocking
 * - [unlock] to release the mutex
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val mutex = Mutex()
 * mutex.guarded {
 *     // Critical section - only one thread can execute this at a time
 *     // Access or modify shared resources safely here
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Creates a new [Mutex] instance.

 * This factory function instantiates a platform-specific implementation of the [Mutex] interface.
 * The created mutex is initially unlocked and ready to be used for thread synchronization.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * val mutex = Mutex()
 * 
 * // Use with explicit lock/unlock
 * mutex.lock()
 * try {
 *     // Critical section
 * } finally {
 *     mutex.unlock()
 * }
 * 
 * // Or use with the guarded extension function
 * mutex.guarded {
 *     // Critical section
 * }
